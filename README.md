<h1>1.Python practice programs:</h1>
<p>1. Create a table with a large number of records (you can find it with a google search or use this
link - https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db). Use MySQL Database. One can setup MySQL on
localhost. Write some basic queries using python. Suppose you want to process/fetch a large
number of records using python while keeping your memory usage low. Think of approaches on
how to accomplish this and implement it.
<br>Hint: Use Generator</p>
<p>2. Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have
a method "get_gender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female
Class.
<br>Bonus: Make class Person an abstract class and make get_gender an abstract method in the
same class. The two child classes must inherit and implement get_gender. i.e., When trying to
initialize an object of class Person, the program must throw an error.
Hint:
Use ABC library (comes natively with Python3
</p>
<p>3. With a given list [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155], write a program to print this
list after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.
Hint: Use set() to store a number of values without duplicates.</p>

<p>4. Write a program that can map() to make a list whose elements are squares of numbers
between 1 and 20 (both included).
<br>Hints:
Use map() to generate a list.
Use Lambda to define anonymous functions.</p>

<p>5. Write a program anti_html.py that takes a URL as an argument, downloads the HTML from
the web, and prints it after stripping HTML tags.</p>
